## ‚öôÔ∏è One-Time Setup (10 minutes)

Follow these steps to set up the local environment. You only need to do this once.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the main repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TKTINC/true_asset_alluse.git
cd true_asset_alluse/local-deployment
```

### Step 2: Run the Automated Setup Script

This script will install Python, create a virtual environment, and install all required dependencies.

```bash
chmod +x setup_macos_enhanced.sh
./setup_macos_enhanced.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure API Keys

The setup script creates a `.env.local` file. Open this file in a text editor and add your API keys from the prerequisite step.

```bash
# .env.local

DATABENTO_API_KEY="YOUR_DATABENTO_API_KEY"
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
NEWS_API_KEY="YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY"
```

### Step 4: Configure IBKR Trader Workstation (TWS)

1. **Launch TWS** on your MacBook Air.
2. **Log in** to your **paper trading account**.
3. Go to **File > Global Configuration > API > Settings**.
4. **Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients**.
5. **Set Socket port** to `7497` (for paper trading).
6. **Add `127.0.0.1`** to the list of trusted IPs.

## üöÄ Demonstration Walkthrough

Here is a suggested flow for demonstrating the system to investors or potential team members:

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Start with the main dashboard. Highlight the **live portfolio value**, **daily P&L**, and **portfolio delta**, explaining that this data is coming directly from your IBKR paper trading account.

2. **AI Assistant Interaction**: Use the chat interface to ask questions about the portfolio. For example:
   - "What is the current risk exposure of my portfolio?"
   - "Analyze the performance of my AAPL position."
   - "What is the current market sentiment?"
   Explain that these are real responses from the OpenAI API based on live data.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Show the market sentiment widget and explain that it's based on real-time news analysis from News API. Click on high-impact news to show the system's ability to filter for important events.

4. **System Health**: Point out the system health widget, showing the live connection status of all integrated services (IBKR, Databento, OpenAI, News API).

5. **Positions Table**: Go through the active positions, explaining that these are real positions from the IBKR paper account. Show how the P&L updates in near real-time.

6. **Live Market Data**: Explain that all the data is being fed in real-time from Databento, a professional-grade market data provider.

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Connection Errors**: Ensure TWS is running and configured correctly. Check that your API keys in `.env.local` are correct.
- **Slow Performance**: Live API calls can sometimes be slow. This is expected and demonstrates the reality of working with external services.
- **No Data**: Make sure you have positions in your IBKR paper trading account for the system to display.
