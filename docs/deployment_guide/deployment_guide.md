## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide to deploying the True-Asset-ALLUSE system in a production environment. It covers the infrastructure requirements, deployment procedures, and post-deployment configuration.

## 2. Infrastructure Requirements

The following infrastructure is required for a production deployment:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: A Kubernetes cluster with at least 3 nodes.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A PostgreSQL database with high availability and regular backups.
- **Redis Cache**: A Redis cache for session management and caching.
- **Load Balancer**: A load balancer to distribute traffic across the API gateway instances.
- **Monitoring System**: A monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for system health monitoring.
- **Logging System**: A logging system (e.g., ELK stack) for centralized logging.

## 3. Deployment Procedures

This section provides a step-by-step guide to deploying the True-Asset-ALLUSE system.

### 3.1. Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Docker must be installed on all nodes.
- **Kubernetes**: A Kubernetes cluster must be set up and configured.
- **Helm**: Helm must be installed for package management.

### 3.2. Deployment Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone the True-Asset-ALLUSE repository from GitHub.
2.  **Build Docker Images**: Build the Docker images for all microservices.
