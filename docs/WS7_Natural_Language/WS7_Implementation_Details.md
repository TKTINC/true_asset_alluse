# WS7: Natural Language Interface & Chatbot - Implementation Details

**Version**: v1.0.0-ws7-complete
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

## 1. Overview

Workstream 7 (WS7) introduces a sophisticated Natural Language Interface and Chatbot system into the True-Asset-ALLUSE platform. This workstream provides human-friendly interaction capabilities while maintaining strict adherence to Constitution v1.3 principles. The system enables users to query system status, request reports, and interact with the platform using natural language, while ensuring **zero AI involvement in wealth management decisions**.

The WS7 system acts as an intelligent interface layer, translating natural language queries into system commands and providing narrative explanations of system behavior and performance.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Zero Decision-Making Authority**: The chatbot and narrative generator cannot initiate, modify, or override any trading or risk management decisions
- **Information Gateway**: Provides read-only access to system information and generates explanatory content
- **Constitution Compliance**: All responses are filtered through Constitution v1.3 compliance checks
- **Transparency**: All AI-generated content is clearly marked and traceable
- **Security**: Implements robust authentication and authorization controls

## 3. Architecture

The WS7 architecture consists of two primary components:

1. **Wealth Chatbot**: GPT-4 powered conversational interface for system interaction
2. **Narrative Generator**: Automated report narration and explanation system
