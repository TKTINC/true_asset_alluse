## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the True-Asset-ALLUSE system architecture. It details the system's components, their interactions, and the overall design principles that guide its development. The True-Asset-ALLUSE system is a fully automated, 100% rules-based wealth management autopilot platform designed for high performance, scalability, and compliance with Constitution v1.3.

## 2. Architectural Principles

The system architecture is guided by the following principles:

- **Modularity**: The system is divided into six independent workstreams, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. This modular design promotes separation of concerns, simplifies development, and enhances maintainability.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing wealth management operations, user loads, and data processing requirements. All components are stateless and can be replicated across multiple servers.
- **Resilience**: The system is designed to be fault-tolerant and resilient to failures. It incorporates redundancy, failover mechanisms, and automatic recovery procedures to ensure high availability for wealth management operations.
- **Security**: Security is a core design consideration. The system implements robust authentication, authorization, and data encryption to protect sensitive wealth information and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Compliance**: The system is designed to be fully compliant with Constitution v1.3. All wealth management decisions are validated against the rules engine to ensure 100% compliance.
- **Extensibility**: The architecture is designed to be extensible to support new features, wealth management strategies, and third-party integrations.

## 3. System Overview

The True-Asset-ALLUSE system is composed of six interconnected workstreams:

- **WS1: Rules Engine & Constitution Framework**: The core of the system, responsible for enforcing Constitution v1.3 and validating all wealth management decisions.
- **WS2: Protocol Engine & Risk Management**: Implements the ATR-based risk management system with 4-level protocol escalation for wealth protection.
- **WS3: Account Management & Forking System**: Manages the three-tiered account structure and intelligent forking logic for wealth scaling.
- **WS4: Market Data & Execution Engine**: Provides real-time market data, Interactive Brokers integration, and position management for wealth operations.
- **WS5: Portfolio Management & Analytics**: Implements portfolio optimization, performance measurement, and risk management for wealth growth.
- **WS6: User Interface & API Layer**: Provides the user-facing components, including the API gateway, web dashboard, and wealth monitoring interface.

## 4. Workstream Architecture

This section provides a detailed description of each workstream's architecture.

### 4.1. WS1: Rules Engine & Constitution Framework

**Components**:
- **Constitution v1.3**: Complete implementation of all 18 sections with rule classes.
- **Rules Engine**: Central orchestrator with a comprehensive validation framework.
- **5 Specialized Validators**: Account, Position Sizing, Timing, Delta Range, and Liquidity.
- **Audit Trail System**: Immutable compliance logging for all rule executions.
- **Compliance Checker**: Comprehensive Constitution adherence verification.

### 4.2. WS2: Protocol Engine & Risk Management

**Components**:
- **ATR Calculation Engine**: Multi-source ATR calculation with data validation.
- **Protocol Escalation System**: 4-level escalation system with automatic frequency adjustment.
- **Roll Economics & Execution**: Intelligent roll decision system with economic analysis.
- **Circuit Breakers & Safety**: Automatic trading halts and safety override mechanisms.

### 4.3. WS3: Account Management & Forking System

**Components**:
- **Account Structure Implementation**: Three-tiered account system (Gen/Rev/Com).
- **Forking Logic & Automation**: Intelligent forking decision engine with risk assessment.
- **Account Merging & Consolidation**: Intelligent consolidation system for account optimization.
- **Performance Attribution System**: Comprehensive performance tracking across forked accounts.

### 4.4. WS4: Market Data & Execution Engine

**Components**:
- **Market Data Infrastructure**: Real-time market data with multi-provider support.
- **Interactive Brokers Integration**: Robust TWS API integration with connection management.
- **Trade Execution Engine**: Comprehensive order management and execution system.
- **Market Monitoring & Alerts**: Real-time market monitoring and multi-channel alerting.

### 4.5. WS5: Portfolio Management & Analytics

**Components**:
- **Portfolio Optimization Engine**: Comprehensive portfolio construction and optimization.
- **Performance Measurement**: Detailed performance attribution and risk-adjusted metrics.
- **Risk Management & Monitoring**: Advanced risk modeling, analysis, and monitoring.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Custom report generation and interactive data visualization.

### 4.6. WS6: User Interface & API Layer

**Components**:
- **API Gateway & Authentication**: FastAPI-based gateway with JWT authentication and RBAC.
- **Web Dashboard Development**: Flask-based dashboard with interactive charts and real-time updates.
- **Trading Interface**: Professional-grade interface for order management and execution.
- **Reporting & Analytics UI**: User-friendly interface for generating and visualizing reports.
- **Mobile & Advanced Features**: Responsive mobile design and third-party API integrations.

## 5. Data Architecture

The system uses a PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage. The database schema is designed to be normalized and efficient, with separate tables for each major entity (accounts, positions, orders, etc.). All sensitive data is encrypted at rest.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

The system is designed to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and resilience. Each workstream is deployed as a separate microservice, with its own set of pods and services. A load balancer is used to distribute traffic across the API gateway instances.

## 7. Security Architecture

The system implements a multi-layered security architecture:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for all API requests.
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce granular permissions.
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Network Security**: The system is deployed in a private network with strict firewall rules.
- **Auditing**: All system activities are logged and audited for compliance and security.

## 8. Conclusion

The True-Asset-ALLUSE system architecture is designed to be a robust, scalable, and compliant platform for automated trading. Its modular design, comprehensive features, and focus on security and resilience make it a powerful tool for professional traders and investment managers.
